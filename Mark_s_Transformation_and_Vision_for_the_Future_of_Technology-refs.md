## Introduction

As Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, reflects on his
personal transformation and the evolution of technology, he notes that
"I'm trying to be less of a main character and more of a foil for other
people" [\[32\]](#t=155). This shift in perspective is reflective of the
changing landscape of technology, where the focus is no longer on
individual achievements but on creating breakthroughs that inspire and
empower billions of people.

Over the past 20 years, technology has undergone significant
transformations, from the early days of Facebook to the current phase of
politics, volatility, and responsibility [\[35\]](#t=169). However, as
Mark notes, "we now understand the different dimensions of that and have
done a ton of work to do the things we need to do" [\[41\]](#t=199),
allowing for a pivot towards more proactive and awesome things.

The next phase of technology is focused on breakthroughs, with Mark
emphasizing that "there's a difference between doing good things and
doing awesome things, and it's a difference in inspiration"
[\[70\]](#t=370). This is reflected in Meta's work on AR glasses and VR
headsets, which have the potential to inspire and empower billions of
people [\[52\]](#t=257).

As Mark looks to the future, he is driven by a desire to build awesome
things, not just good things. He notes that "life is too short" and that
"the biggest scarcity that we have is just the amount of time that we
have" [\[79\]](#t=411), emphasizing the importance of focusing on what
truly matters.

In this paper, we will explore the evolution of technology and the
importance of creating breakthroughs that inspire and empower people. We
will examine the challenges and opportunities of building awesome things
and discuss the lessons learned from Mark's experiences as a founder and
CEO. As Mark notes, "there's a lot of awesome stuff that will get built"
[\[250\]](#t=1347), and it is our hope that this paper will contribute
to that conversation.

## Discussion

### Personal Transformation

Mark, you've had a personal transformation in the past couple of years.
[\[17\]](#t=92) [\[18\]](#t=95) What led to this transformation?
[\[19\]](#t=102) Mark: I injured my knee, so I had to stop fighting and
training for nine months. [\[20\]](#t=107) [\[21\]](#t=111)
[\[22\]](#t=113) I decided to grow out my hair, and it's been a great
experience. [\[23\]](#t=117) [\[24\]](#t=121) [\[25\]](#t=128)
[\[26\]](#t=133) [\[27\]](#t=135) [\[28\]](#t=140) [\[29\]](#t=140)

### The Evolution of Technology

You've been the main character in technology for the last 20 years.
[\[30\]](#t=142) How would you delineate the chapters you've seen, and
what chapter do you think we are in now? [\[31\]](#t=148) Mark: I'm
trying to be less of a main character and more of a foil for other
people. [\[32\]](#t=155) [\[33\]](#t=155) [\[34\]](#t=157) We've gone
through different phases, from the early Facebook days to the last ten
years, which have been marked by politics, volatility, and
responsibility. [\[35\]](#t=169) [\[36\]](#t=170) [\[37\]](#t=172)
[\[38\]](#t=179) [\[39\]](#t=180) [\[40\]](#t=195) I think we now
understand the different dimensions of that and have done a ton of work
to do the things we need to do. [\[41\]](#t=199) [\[42\]](#t=207) This
has allowed us to pivot more to offense and doing more proactive,
awesome things. [\[43\]](#t=209)

### The Next Phase of Computing

When I think about the next phase, I think about doing breakthrough
things that are more awesome and inspiring, regardless of scale.
[\[44\]](#t=218) [\[45\]](#t=224) [\[46\]](#t=230) [\[47\]](#t=232)
[\[48\]](#t=235) [\[49\]](#t=238) [\[50\]](#t=246) [\[51\]](#t=251) For
the next computing platform, with AR glasses and VR headsets, I think
we're going to get to a point where billions of people are going to have
these things. [\[52\]](#t=257) [\[53\]](#t=272) [\[54\]](#t=288)
[\[55\]](#t=290) [\[56\]](#t=298) [\[57\]](#t=302) [\[58\]](#t=312) The
experience of trying on AR glasses for the first time is awesome and
inspiring. [\[59\]](#t=318) [\[60\]](#t=329) [\[61\]](#t=335)
[\[62\]](#t=339) [\[63\]](#t=343) [\[64\]](#t=345) [\[65\]](#t=358) I
think that's what I'm excited about for the next phase of my career.
[\[66\]](#t=359) [\[67\]](#t=363) [\[68\]](#t=363) [\[69\]](#t=364)

### Doing Awesome Things

I have a saying that I like to tell people at Meta: there's a difference
between doing good things and doing awesome things, and it's a
difference in inspiration. [\[70\]](#t=370) [\[71\]](#t=379)
[\[72\]](#t=381) [\[73\]](#t=382) I think this is a phase to try to be
awesome and try to build some awesome things. [\[74\]](#t=386) As you
said, one of the catchlines we use at SPC is that you come here to throw
away the good ideas in favor of the great ones. [\[75\]](#t=393) I think
I'm going to update that to throwing away the good ideas in favor of the
awesome ones. [\[76\]](#t=402) [\[77\]](#t=403) [\[78\]](#t=407)
[\[79\]](#t=411) [\[80\]](#t=413)

I think we can all have good ideas, but it's the awesome ones that we're
going for. [\[80\]](#t=413) Speaking of ten-year arcs, I think one of
the things that we tend to forget in the excitement of these LLM
releases, particularly with Llama, is that you started FAIR almost ten
years ago. [\[81\]](#t=419) One of the last projects I remember working
on with you at Facebook personally was Coefficient back in 2010, trying
to put a weight on every edge on our graph using machine learning
techniques. [\[82\]](#t=432)

### The Early Days of FAIR

When you started investing in FAIR, can you take us through the early
days? [\[88\]](#t=459) I mean, back in 2014, we were still in the AI
winter. [\[89\]](#t=465) What were some of the seeds that you were
trying to plant back in the minus one to zero days of FAIR?
[\[91\]](#t=470)

### Building the Next Platform

Yeah, so after 2012, when Facebook went public and reached a billion
people, I was trying to figure out what's next. [\[92\]](#t=478) Because
Facebook was still growing, which is mind-boggling, but I was like,
"Okay, what's the next step?" [\[96\]](#t=504) Part of it was, "Okay, I
built one social app, but can we build four more billion-people apps or
take things that started small and build them to be really big?"
[\[97\]](#t=507)

### Defining the Next Major Platform

And then it was like, "Okay, what are the next platforms?"
[\[99\]](#t=523) We didn't play a role in defining smartphones, and we
tried later with Android, but it was clear that this platform was
solidified, and we weren't going to influence it much. [\[104\]](#t=544)
So even though it might take 15 or 20 years for the next major platform
to come about, I knew I had to start working on it. [\[105\]](#t=552)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Mark's transformation and vision for the future of
technology are centered around building "awesome things" that inspire
billions of people. As he reflects on the past 20 years in technology,
from the early Facebook days to the current phase of politics,
volatility, and responsibility, Mark emphasizes the importance of doing
"breakthrough things that are more awesome and inspiring, regardless of
scale" [\[44\]](#t=218). He believes that the next phase of his career
will be focused on working on things that are "more awesome and
inspiring" [\[52\]](#t=257), such as AR glasses and VR headsets, which
will enable billions of people to experience new and innovative
technologies.

Mark's approach to entrepreneurship and building companies is centered
around the idea of "minus one to zero" [\[4\]](#t=23), which means
exploring new ideas and spaces without being too committed to a specific
outcome. He believes that this approach allows for more flexibility and
creativity, and that it is essential for building successful companies.
As he says, "I think that's one of the things that's the weirdest about
this, is it's kind of comforting to think, hey, there are all these
things that people should be on and someone else has got this, right?
And it's like, no, no one else has got this" [\[245\]](#t=1314).

Mark also emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships and
trust with others. He believes that working with people who share
similar values and goals is essential for building successful companies
and achieving great things. As he says, "I want to work on this project
to raise the highest quality beef in the world, and it's like, all
right. And it's like, why? I don't know, but it's like... doing it with
some people who I think are awesome" [\[679\]](#t=3381).

In terms of advice for entrepreneurs and technologists, Mark emphasizes
the importance of being open to new ideas and experiences. He believes
that trying new things and taking risks is essential for learning and
growth, and that it is never too late to start something new. As he
says, "I think you can do whatever you want as long as you put your mind
to it" [\[236\]](#t=1273).

Overall, Mark's vision for the future of technology is centered around
building innovative and inspiring technologies that enable people to
experience new and exciting things. His approach to entrepreneurship and
building companies is centered around the idea of "minus one to zero",
and he emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships and
trust with others. As he says, "I think that's what matters to me at
this phase of my life, though" [\[700\]](#t=3504).

    transformation?
20. [00:01:47](None#t=107): Well, I injured my knee, so I was like, all
    right.
21. [00:01:51](None#t=111): It was kind of like I had my hair cut short.
22. [00:01:53](None#t=113): Cause I was like, fighting and training
    before, and then I was like, all right, I can't do this for nine
    months.
23. [00:01:57](None#t=117): So, like, and by the way, this week I'm
    officially healed.
24. [00:02:01](None#t=121): So, like, ready for some violence, but I
    might keep the hair.
25. [00:02:08](None#t=128): But I don't know, it's like I kind of had
    this sort of fro thing when I was younger.
26. [00:02:13](None#t=133): I think Priscilla or someone was like, hey,
    you should grow that out.
27. [00:02:15](None#t=135): I was like, you know, I'm not doing anything
    else for the next nine months, so it's looking great.
28. [00:02:20](None#t=140): It's looking great.
29. [00:02:20](None#t=140): Yeah, it's looking great.
30. [00:02:22](None#t=142): On that note, you've also been the main
    character in technology for the last 20 years.
31. [00:02:28](None#t=148): How would you delineate the chapters you've
    seen and what chapter do you think we are in now?
32. [00:02:35](None#t=155): I don't know.
33. [00:02:35](None#t=155): I'm trying to be less of a main character.
34. [00:02:37](None#t=157): I think it's working a little bit for me to
    just be a foil for other people.
35. [00:02:49](None#t=169): I don't know.
36. [00:02:50](None#t=170): I mean, we've gone through all these
    different phases, right?
37. [00:02:52](None#t=172): I mean, there was like the kind of early
    Facebook, get it to work, survive phase.
38. [00:02:59](None#t=179): I don't know.
39. [00:03:00](None#t=180): Then, like, I'd say the last ten years,
    there's all like, just kind of all the weight of the politics and
    volatility and responsibility around all that stuff has been just
    like a very different phase for the company.
40. [00:03:15](None#t=195): And obviously that's not done.
41. [00:03:19](None#t=199): But I do think we now understand the
    different dimensions of that and have done a ton of work to do the
    things that we need to do.
42. [00:03:27](None#t=207): And I feel better about that.
43. [00:03:29](None#t=209): And I think that's allowed us to pivot more,
    to just offense and doing more proactive, awesome things.
44. [00:03:38](None#t=218): And when I think about the next phase, there
    are a lot of ways to do awesome things, I think, in the world.
45. [00:03:44](None#t=224): And the way that I think social media ended
    up being good is it gives everyone a voice.
46. [00:03:50](None#t=230): It helps you connect.
47. [00:03:52](None#t=232): Lots of people use it.
48. [00:03:55](None#t=235): I don't actually think it's super
    groundbreaking.
49. [00:03:58](None#t=238): It's basically you're giving people an
    ability to do something that's pretty fundamental and basic, and it
    just required really good execution.
50. [00:04:06](None#t=246): I think it's profound at large scale, but I
    think the scale is the thing that makes it sort of interesting.
51. [00:04:11](None#t=251): So it's very much one to n, to use your
    analogy.
52. [00:04:17](None#t=257): And I kind of think for the next phase of my
    career and what I want to do for the next ten to 15 years, it's more
    working on just sort of breakthrough things that are more awesome
    and inspiring, regardless of scale.
53. [00:04:32](None#t=272): So obviously, for the next computing
    platform stuff that we're doing with AR glasses and VR headsets and
    all that stuff, I do think we're going to get to a point where
    billions of people are going to have these things.
54. [00:04:48](None#t=288): It's like billions of people already wear
    glasses.
55. [00:04:50](None#t=290): It's everyone who just had a not smartphone
    easily upgraded to a smartphone, and then the rest of people were a
    little slower.
56. [00:04:58](None#t=298): I think here it's like everyone who has
    glasses is going to get smart glasses.
57. [00:05:02](None#t=302): Maybe everyone else will kind of come along
    over time or have different form factors, but regardless, that
    journey might take ten or 15 years.
58. [00:05:12](None#t=312): And I think that that's pretty normal for
    building something that's that fundamental in the world.
59. [00:05:18](None#t=318): But the experience when you just try on the
    AR glasses for the first time, and we have our first working
    prototype of this now, and it's like, it's awesome.
60. [00:05:29](None#t=329): Actually, we were working on this and I
    wanted it to be our first consumer product, but actually I want the
    first consumer version of it to be even better.
61. [00:05:35](None#t=335): So we're just like, all right, let's just
    take the first one and we'll kind of have it be a prototype.
62. [00:05:39](None#t=339): But when people try this on, they're just
    like, it's just giddy.
63. [00:05:43](None#t=343): It's inspiring.
64. [00:05:45](None#t=345): It's just a thing that you haven't
    experienced before, just being able to kind of play with holograms
    and things in the world as if they're, I don't know, as if they're
    just physically there in a normal form factor pair of glasses.
65. [00:05:58](None#t=358): It's just this wild thing.
66. [00:05:59](None#t=359): So for me that's a lot of that.
67. [00:06:03](None#t=363): I think that there's.
68. [00:06:03](None#t=363): That there's the AI version of that.
69. [00:06:04](None#t=364): I assume we'll spend some more time talking
    about that, but I don't know, it's more just doing awesome things.
70. [00:06:10](None#t=370): I have the saying that I like to tell people
    at meta that there's a difference between doing good things and
    doing awesome things, and it's a difference in inspiration.
71. [00:06:19](None#t=379): And good is good too.
72. [00:06:21](None#t=381): You can be awesome and not good.
73. [00:06:22](None#t=382): They're two different, almost orthogonal
    directions.
74. [00:06:26](None#t=386): But I don't know, I think this is a phase to
    try to be awesome and try to build some awesome things.
75. [00:06:33](None#t=393): I mean, it's interesting, I think that one
    of the catch lines that we use for SVC is that you come here to
    throw away the good ideas in favor of the great ones.
76. [00:06:42](None#t=402): So I think I'm going to update that.
77. [00:06:43](None#t=403): So you throw away the good ideas in favor of
    the awesome ones?
78. [00:06:47](None#t=407): No, I mean really, because I think that life
    is too short.
79. [00:06:51](None#t=411): The biggest scarcity that we have is just
    the amount of time that we have.
80. [00:06:53](None#t=413): So I think we can all have good ideas, but
    it's the awesome ones that we're going for.
81. [00:06:59](None#t=419): Speaking of ten year arcs, I think one of
    the things that we tend to forget in the giddiness of these LLM
    releases, and particularly with Lama, is that you started fair
    almost ten years ago.
82. [00:07:12](None#t=432): In fact, one of the last projects I remember
    working on with you at Facebook personally, was coefficient back in
    like 2010, trying to put a weight on every edge on our graph using
    machine learning techniques.
83. [00:07:23](None#t=443): Good one.
84. [00:07:23](None#t=443): Yeah, I think it worked out well.
85. [00:07:27](None#t=447): So it ended up being somewhat important.
86. [00:07:31](None#t=451): I'm grateful for your work.
87. [00:07:33](None#t=453): Thank you.
88. [00:07:39](None#t=459): But when you started investing in fair, can
    you take us through the early days of maybe what minus?
89. [00:07:45](None#t=465): I mean, back in 2014, we were still kind of
    in the AI winter.
90. [00:07:50](None#t=470): I think that.
91. [00:07:50](None#t=470): So what were some of the seeds that you were
    trying to plant maybe back in the minus one to zero days of fair?
92. [00:07:58](None#t=478): Yeah, so after, I guess like around 2012.
93. [00:08:01](None#t=481): So that was when we went public and Facebook
    reached a billion people and I was kind of trying to figure out
    what's next.
94. [00:08:07](None#t=487): Right.
95. [00:08:07](None#t=487): Because obviously Facebook goes on to scale
    to three plus billion people and it's still growing, which is sort
    of mind boggling to, I think people kind of assume it's just tapped
    out, but it's not still doing awesome.
96. [00:08:24](None#t=504): But at that point, I was kind of like, okay,
    well, what's the next step?
97. [00:08:27](None#t=507): And part of it was, okay, I built one social
    app, so that's good, but there's kind of this vibe of, okay, you can
    do it once, maybe there's some luck in that, but can we just go
    build four more billion people apps or take things that started to
    be pretty small and build them to be really big?
98. [00:08:42](None#t=522): So that was one part.
99. [00:08:43](None#t=523): And then it was like, okay, well, what are
    the next platforms?
100. [00:08:45](None#t=525): And this is something I thought about a
     bunch, because social media and the apps that we're building kind
     of got started around the same time as smartphones.
101. [00:08:55](None#t=535): So we didn't play any role in defining
     smartphones.
102. [00:08:59](None#t=539): And we tried later, it's like, there's
     Android.
103. [00:09:01](None#t=541): We took this cut at this phone thing.
104. [00:09:04](None#t=544): The quick lesson from that is like, all
     right, this platform's pretty stable and solidified, and that's
     like, we're not going to really be able to influence that much.
105. [00:09:12](None#t=552): So even though it might take 15 or 20 years
     for the next major platform to come about and be at the same scale
     as phones are today, that's what I got to do.
106. [00:09:23](None#t=563): I'm not going to hit my head against the
     wall just trying to create another phone variant when that thing is
     similar.
107. [00:09:30](None#t=570): And also, there are a couple of issues with
     building on other platforms, and one is just the lack of control
     over your own destiny, which I think is just really frustrating.
108. [00:09:41](None#t=581): I think when you're starting, you're
     navigating all this stuff and the wind is blowing in all these
     directions and there's a million things that can kill you.
109. [00:09:47](None#t=587): So it's not that big of a deal.
110. [00:09:48](None#t=588): But then when you get to be a bigger
     company, you're trying to, I don't know, you want to make longer
     term bets, which means that you want more stability of the
     assumptions of your environment, having more control over the
     infrastructure that you have.
111. [00:10:01](None#t=601): And knowing that you build something,
     someone's not just going to tell you you can't ship it, or they're
     not just going to change the ground underneath you or whatever is
     pretty important.
112. [00:10:10](None#t=610): Another thing is, I mean, this may just be
     kind of more specific for me, but when you're building social apps,
     it's kind of this weird thing that you primarily are delivering
     them through this tiny little screen that people carry around.
113. [00:10:22](None#t=622): It's a really, in some ways, antisocial
     form factor.
114. [00:10:26](None#t=626): And it's part of the reason why I care so
     much about glasses.
115. [00:10:29](None#t=629): It's just like such a more natural thing.
116. [00:10:31](None#t=631): Okay, so 2012 was right around when we kind
     of started looking at what's next, and we started fair and we
     started.
117. [00:10:38](None#t=638): And we bought Oculus, because at the time,
     I was kind of, this is actually something I think back about
     because I'm like, all right, could we have started working on VR
     and AR without oculus?
118. [00:10:50](None#t=650): I'm not sure.
119. [00:10:51](None#t=651): I mean, I think, like, in theory, yes.
120. [00:10:53](None#t=653): I mean, we, like, put a ton of work into
     it, but at the time, I mean, you remember it when you were there.
121. [00:10:59](None#t=659): It was kind of like the ethos of the
     company at the time was not actually oriented around, like, let's
     just go, like, have some groups sitting in a corner for like five
     years building something separate.
122. [00:11:10](None#t=670): It was almost like we needed the separate
     seed of a thing to kind of go incubate it, to even get our culture
     to accept that it was going to be a thing, even though I'd kind of
     decided like, no, we're doing this right.
123. [00:11:23](None#t=683): So, yeah, so we got.
124. [00:11:24](None#t=684): So we kind of started the AI thing with
     fair.
125. [00:11:29](None#t=689): I did want to buy DeepMind, but they went
     to Google.
126. [00:11:35](None#t=695): Demos was good, by the way.
127. [00:11:36](None#t=696): He totally did a very good job of playing
     me off of Google to get a good price, which I respect.
128. [00:11:42](None#t=702): And power to him.
129. [00:11:43](None#t=703): Respect the guy, power to him.
130. [00:11:47](None#t=707): But, yeah, so we kind of did it ourselves.
131. [00:11:50](None#t=710): And I guess because we didn't end up having
     this closed lab, we ended up getting all these academic folks.
132. [00:11:56](None#t=716): And that sort of laid the foundation for
     the kind of philosophical approach being overwhelmingly open source
     in the work.
133. [00:12:05](None#t=725): And we'd done that with a bunch of other
     stuff at meta Facebook at the time.
134. [00:12:09](None#t=729): But the AI stuff, I think especially was
     really, it was kind of academic open Yann Lecun, a bunch of the,
     like, the kind of foundational people he brought in.
135. [00:12:18](None#t=738): But I don't know, at the time, there wasn't
     like a product.
136. [00:12:22](None#t=742): Right.
137. [00:12:22](None#t=742): I mean, one of the things I struggled with
     for, until really, the latest wave of the AI assistance came out is
     we really looked at this mostly.
138. [00:12:31](None#t=751): It's like we did fundamental research.
139. [00:12:34](None#t=754): It got its way into all of our ranking and
     recommendations and ads things and delivered really big results for
     the company.
140. [00:12:39](None#t=759): But it wasn't like a single product, which
     sort of lacks a sense of awesomeness in the sense that we were
     talking about before, because in the way that the Alphago stuff or
     the alpha fold stuff that DeepMind did, I just think, is really
     inspiring.
141. [00:12:54](None#t=774): It's like you look at that and you're like,
     okay.
142. [00:12:56](None#t=776): It's just a really singular big
     contribution to the field.
143. [00:13:02](None#t=782): So I kind of hit my head against the wall
     on that, on AI for a while.
144. [00:13:05](None#t=785): But I think more recently with the advent
     of being able to build different kinds of assistants, I just think
     that's the product hook.
145. [00:13:13](None#t=793): So we're going to have meta AI.
146. [00:13:14](None#t=794): It's on track to being the most used
     assistant in the world.
147. [00:13:18](None#t=798): Feel good about that.
148. [00:13:19](None#t=799): We're going to make it so every creator and
     every small business and every person can create their own virtual
     assistants or virtual companions or the different things that they
     want.
149. [00:13:27](None#t=807): You'll have NPC's in the metaverse, playing
     games, all this kind of stuff.
150. [00:13:30](None#t=810): I think that that's going to be awesome.
151. [00:13:32](None#t=812): But it did take a while to figure that out.
152. [00:13:33](None#t=813): But I think it was back to 2012.
153. [00:13:35](None#t=815): 2014 was around the time we're like, all
     right, these are the two next things that we need to go do or AI in
     the metaverse.
154. [00:13:41](None#t=821): I mean, it's incredible to me just to kind
     of see how long you have to plant some of these seeds for.
155. [00:13:45](None#t=825): Yeah, no, it just takes so long.
156. [00:13:47](None#t=827): I mean, honestly, like, it's way longer
     than I would have thought.
157. [00:13:50](None#t=830): So I think that's like, one of the lessons
     with entrepreneurship is it's almost like you have to be really
     excited about what you're doing because it's otherwise, it's really
     too painful to be rational to actually do not rational.
158. [00:14:04](None#t=844): So, you know, one of the big open questions
     with AI has been kind of one of the, I would say, talking points
     that a lot of people say is that most of the value will accrue to
     either the bigger kind of, like players, either through either the
     bigger labs or kind of like some of the bigger kind of, whether it
     be a Google or a Microsoft, and that there's very little for the
     startups to essentially compete for simply because they don't have
     scale.
159. [00:14:30](None#t=870): And you're obviously both a big company,
     but you're also kind of providing this incredible resources to all
     of us to kind of like, push in some ways from the other side.
160. [00:14:39](None#t=879): So how do you see, like, what advice would
     you have to this room full of founders as they try to navigate?
161. [00:14:46](None#t=886): Like, this particular question of, like,
     scale versus not scale.
162. [00:14:49](None#t=889): Like, how do you compete against the bigger
     players and so on?
163. [00:14:53](None#t=893): Yeah, I mean, I think that there's going to
     be almost every product category I think is going to get disrupted.
164. [00:14:58](None#t=898): There's going to be new stuff that can get
     built.
165. [00:14:59](None#t=899): So some things are fundamentally very large
     investment oriented things, and those are not well suited to start.
166. [00:15:05](None#t=905): So, for example, building large foundation
     models that are going to train, requiring tens of billions of
     dollars to train.
167. [00:15:12](None#t=912): It's like, all right, there will probably
     be a relatively smaller number of companies that do that, but I
     think the good news is that that hopefully will be somewhat of a
     commodity over time.
168. [00:15:21](None#t=921): And I'm not sure that's where most of the
     value is going to be.
169. [00:15:24](None#t=924): Whereas what you can build on top of that,
     I just think all these different categories of things are going to
     get built.
170. [00:15:29](None#t=929): I look at every part of what we do is going
     to get changed in some way.
171. [00:15:33](None#t=933): Feeds are going to go from it was already
     friend content and now it's largely creators.
172. [00:15:37](None#t=937): In the future, a lot of it is going to be
     AI generated ads.
173. [00:15:41](None#t=941): You're going from advertisers targeting
     stuff to now it's like an advertiser's just going to give us a
     business objective that they want, and we're going to produce the
     creative for them and find the people.
174. [00:15:49](None#t=949): It's just wild.
175. [00:15:51](None#t=951): All the metaverse stuff, it's like you go
     from having all these developers building out these worlds to it
     just being more generated, almost like a dream, like a lucid dream
     as you're walking through it, it's going to be wild.
176. [00:16:03](None#t=963): There's going to be all this stuff.
177. [00:16:04](None#t=964): You can point to almost any product
     experience that's out there, and I think that they'll change.
178. [00:16:08](None#t=968): And some of that.
179. [00:16:11](None#t=971): There may be some larger company that has
     some distribution advantage, but like, I don't know, large
     companies are slow and they lack conviction.
180. [00:16:19](None#t=979): And I think is one of the advantages, I
     think, of being a kind of founder driven large company.
181. [00:16:25](None#t=985): But one of the kind of things that I've
     thought about from time to time is why was it the case that we were
     able to build Facebook and that some other company didn't?
182. [00:16:33](None#t=993): It wasn't like it was a super novel idea.
183. [00:16:36](None#t=996): I mean, there was friendster before there
     were MySpace.
184. [00:16:38](None#t=998): There's all this stuff, Google, Microsoft,
     Yahoo.
185. [00:16:40](None#t=1000): They all had versions of it.
186. [00:16:42](None#t=1002): Why didn't they do it?
187. [00:16:43](None#t=1003): And I think it's like, I mean, we kind of
     watched them, right, in the early days, it's like fumbling around.
188. [00:16:48](None#t=1008): And it's not that they had a lack of
     talent.
189. [00:16:51](None#t=1011): I mean, we were like a ragtag group of
     children, right?
190. [00:16:56](None#t=1016): And they had all these serious engineers,
     serious engineers and serious infrastructure.
191. [00:17:03](None#t=1023): So I kind of think the reason is because
     people doubt new ideas before they come to fruition.
192. [00:17:08](None#t=1028): So the narrative with social networking is
     like, eh, just like this college kid thing.
193. [00:17:13](None#t=1033): It's like, okay, fine, maybe not college
     kids, but it's probably a fad.
194. [00:17:16](None#t=1036): Oh, okay, maybe it seems like it's going
     to be around for a while, but it's probably not going to make
     money.
195. [00:17:19](None#t=1039): Oh, it's making money, but the switch to
     mobile is going to be pretty hard.
196. [00:17:23](None#t=1043): And then it's like, okay, by the time we
     figure that out, it was too late for anyone to go for the companies
     that lost their advantage.
197. [00:17:29](None#t=1049): And so what was the issue?
198. [00:17:30](None#t=1050): I don't know.
199. [00:17:31](None#t=1051): There's probably some team buried deep
     inside those companies that believed in it, and probably some vp
     person who is like, eh, that's probably not the biggest priority,
     and just like pour some, I don't know, sand in the gears or
     whatever analogy you want.
200. [00:17:46](None#t=1066): So I do think that even for the things
     that look like they belong to large companies as opportunities
     because they have a big distribution, advantageous, I would guess
     that big companies are going to fumble two thirds of those.
201. [00:17:58](None#t=1078): And then there are all these things where
     there is not an apparent new big advantage because it plugs into an
     existing distribution channel and those are just free and open to
     take.
202. [00:18:09](None#t=1089): But I don't know, I think that this is
     going to be huge.
203. [00:18:11](None#t=1091): The llama thing that we're doing, I
     obviously believe a lot in open source.
204. [00:18:16](None#t=1096): I think it's good for the world more
     broadly.
205. [00:18:19](None#t=1099): We're not doing this because we're
     altruistic.
206. [00:18:22](None#t=1102): We're doing it because we want to build a
     platform that we know that we can rely on having Lama as a thing.
207. [00:18:29](None#t=1109): And the reality is this is an ecosystem
     and it's not a singular piece of software that we could just build
     and deploy ourselves.
208. [00:18:35](None#t=1115): It gets better when you have all the
     silicon providers optimizing all of their stacks for the thing that
     we're doing.
209. [00:18:42](None#t=1122): And when you have all these other
     companies or startups or different folks who are building different
     distillation tools or inference tools to make it go faster, more
     efficient, and all that stuff, all these people were building stuff
     on it and we released the segment anything model, it's different
     from llama, but even in the first week or two since it's out, you
     just have all these people running all these videos through and the
     model gets better.
210. [00:19:07](None#t=1147): So I think this is going to be good for
     everyone.
211. [00:19:09](None#t=1149): I think open source is going to, it's kind
     of this question of like, I don't know, when you think about the
     future of computing platforms I think there's this huge amount of
     recency bias where people assume that because, like, iPhone won and
     it's like that the closed model is going to win, that's just sort
     of where the world is.
212. [00:19:29](None#t=1169): And I don't know, I think that future is
     not written.
213. [00:19:33](None#t=1173): It's like if you look back at PCs, Windows
     was the leading platform.
214. [00:19:36](None#t=1176): And there's always an open approach.
215. [00:19:38](None#t=1178): There's always a closed approach.
216. [00:19:39](None#t=1179): Each has its own pros and cons.
217. [00:19:42](None#t=1182): But I think a lot of this stuff just
     depends on who goes and does it.
218. [00:19:46](None#t=1186): And I think that's true both for the
     startup opportunities versus whatever kind of lazy big company
     there is.
219. [00:19:51](None#t=1191): And I think that that's true for whether
     the open platform versus the closed one ends up being the kind of
     leading one in the next spaces, whether that's AI or metaverse.
220. [00:20:00](None#t=1200): I'm going to jump ahead to the next
     section.
221. [00:20:02](None#t=1202): And this one anecdote and kind of story I
     want to share that's actually been somewhat kind of, I would say a
     defining moment of defining 30 seconds of my life, which is that
     back in 2005, pretty close to when I first started at Facebook,
     maybe like this is week two or week three, trying to figure out
     what to do, nobody was really giving me much direction.
222. [00:20:25](None#t=1225): And I remember Mark walked up to me, not
     like a very clear management structure.
223. [00:20:29](None#t=1229): Not a very clear management structure.
224. [00:20:30](None#t=1230): Yeah, exactly.
225. [00:20:31](None#t=1231): It's chaos, chaos, control, chaos.
226. [00:20:34](None#t=1234): I remember Mark walking up to me and he's
     like, hey, dude, I think you should write a search engine for
     Facebook.
227. [00:20:40](None#t=1240): Yeah, just you.
228. [00:20:41](None#t=1241): Yeah, it's like you and what team, right?
229. [00:20:44](None#t=1244): And he's really important because when
     people come onto Facebook, the first thing they want to do is
     search for people, make sure you don't fuck it up.
230. [00:20:52](None#t=1252): And then my first reaction was like, mark,
     I don't know how to write a search engine.
231. [00:20:55](None#t=1255): I've never done this.
232. [00:20:56](None#t=1256): Why don't we go hire somebody from Google
     or Yahoo to do this?
233. [00:21:00](None#t=1260): And he looked at me, he's like, dude, if I
     can build Facebook, you can build a damn search engine.
234. [00:21:07](None#t=1267): And you did, and I did, and I did.
235. [00:21:10](None#t=1270): There's like.
236. [00:21:13](None#t=1273): And when I say it was the, like 30 seconds
     that I still think about, which is that I just think that we don't,
     like, all of us can build whatever we put our minds to.
237. [00:21:25](None#t=1285): And this is kind of the culture that, for
     me still defines Facebook, right?
238. [00:21:28](None#t=1288): Which is that there is this hacker can do
     total ownership culture that if I could actually tell every startup
     in the world to, like, take one thing, which is that all of you can
     do whatever you want as long as you put your mind to it.
239. [00:21:39](None#t=1299): It's probably easier than you think.
240. [00:21:42](None#t=1302): There's a question in here.
241. [00:21:43](None#t=1303): I don't know.
242. [00:21:44](None#t=1304): I think sometimes it takes longer than
     you.
243. [00:21:46](None#t=1306): It takes longer, but you can.
244. [00:21:48](None#t=1308): And I think a lot of the stuff that seems
     obvious, there's just not someone else who's actually gonna go do
     it.
245. [00:21:54](None#t=1314): So I think that's one of the things that's
     the weirdest about this, is it's kind of comforting to think, hey,
     there are all these things that people should be on and someone
     else has got this, right?
246. [00:22:05](None#t=1325): And it's like, no, no one else has got
     this.
247. [00:22:07](None#t=1327): I think we're the grownups now.
248. [00:22:11](None#t=1331): I want to go back to Lama and open
     sourcing Lama for a second.
249. [00:22:16](None#t=1336): I'm curious, what kinds of real world
     examples do you want to see built on Lama?
250. [00:22:27](None#t=1347): I don't know.
251. [00:22:28](None#t=1348): I think that there's a lot of awesome
     stuff that will get built, but I actually don't have a specific
     vision for that from my perspective.
252. [00:22:36](None#t=1356): I just want everyone to be using it
     because I think that the more people who are using it, the more the
     flywheel is going to spin for making llama better.
253. [00:22:45](None#t=1365): And I mean, this is maybe like a very
     selfish and parochial answer, but then that makes it so I can build
     the things I want to build better.
254. [00:22:52](None#t=1372): But honestly, I think people should take
     comfort in that answer because I think one of the big questions
     that people have about our open source strategy is like, why are
     you doing this?
255. [00:22:59](None#t=1379): Like, you're building this, like, you kind
     of train this model and then you just give it away.
256. [00:23:04](None#t=1384): Like, is that sustainable?
257. [00:23:05](None#t=1385): I mean, when, like, when llama four or
     llama five takes many billions of dollars to train.
258. [00:23:09](None#t=1389): Or you're just going to give it away and
     it's like, yeah, yeah.
259. [00:23:12](None#t=1392): I don't view it as giving it away.
260. [00:23:13](None#t=1393): I view it as like, you guys all making it
     better for me.
261. [00:23:16](None#t=1396): So I actually don't care what you all do
     as long as it's responsible.
262. [00:23:23](None#t=1403): And like, no, I mean, I think the safety
     is important, right.
263. [00:23:27](None#t=1407): There are all these questions around AI
     ethics and safety and security.
264. [00:23:33](None#t=1413): And I think that that stuff ends up being
     really important.
265. [00:23:35](None#t=1415): We take a huge amount of time.
266. [00:23:37](None#t=1417): This is probably one of the biggest things
     that's part of training that makes open source difficult is if we
     were building it for just ourselves, there are certain assumptions
     that we can make, like that we'd have multiple layers of the stack
     in addition to just the model itself that could filter out bad
     stuff.
267. [00:23:54](None#t=1434): So bad queries that come in outputs that
     it generates that are kind of unintentionally bad.
268. [00:23:59](None#t=1439): And we've tried to replicate some of that
     with the open source stuff.
269. [00:24:02](None#t=1442): And we built this whole llamaguard system.
270. [00:24:04](None#t=1444): It's meant to be deployed as an overall
     system, but fundamentally we have to put way more energy into
     training the actual underlying model because it can be used as just
     a model with all those other layers.
271. [00:24:15](None#t=1455): And that, I think is.
272. [00:24:16](None#t=1456): So maybe this is sort of a negative answer
     to your question, but I mean, pretty much, I think part of what's
     good about having open platforms is people go build stuff that you
     didn't even imagine.
273. [00:24:25](None#t=1465): So I don't know.
274. [00:24:25](None#t=1465): I don't know what to ask people to build.
275. [00:24:27](None#t=1467): I mean, you all figure that out.
276. [00:24:29](None#t=1469): But I think that the thing that, that I
     kind of worry about with it is I think some of the, both the
     opportunities and the challenges around safety are bigger.
277. [00:24:38](None#t=1478): I do think that a lot of the open source
     safety debate has been framed around, like, okay, because of what I
     just said, open source must be fundamentally sort of less safe.
278. [00:24:48](None#t=1488): I actually think once you take that, if
     you do a good job of it, it gets more safe for the reason that open
     source software has been more secure over time.
279. [00:24:54](None#t=1494): It just, it's open.
280. [00:24:54](None#t=1494): It's, you know, it's like people can
     scrutinize it more.
281. [00:24:57](None#t=1497): It's counterintuitive at first with open
     source, people are like, hey, well, hackers can see all the holes.
282. [00:25:02](None#t=1502): Isn't it going to make it less safe?
283. [00:25:03](None#t=1503): It's like, no, you just fix the holes
     faster and then everyone patches it.
284. [00:25:05](None#t=1505): And the same thing is going to happen with
     Lama, I think.
285. [00:25:07](None#t=1507): Is that.
286. [00:25:08](None#t=1508): Yeah, it's like people point out issues.
287. [00:25:10](None#t=1510): We're going to keep on doing dot releases,
     we'll keep on doing big releases.
288. [00:25:12](None#t=1512): I think developers will keep on wanting to
     roll out the most recent models and they'll apply their fine tuning
     patches to that, to the most recent models and it'll be awesome.
289. [00:25:20](None#t=1520): So, yeah, I don't know, but I think
     there's the whole stack, everything from the silicon and the data
     centers.
290. [00:25:26](None#t=1526): And we did the whole open compute thing
     before, sort of similar where it was like, all right, we're
     designing our own data centers and our own servers, and let's just
     see if we can give this away.
291. [00:25:38](None#t=1538): Then maybe the whole industry will sort of
     standardize around our designs and then the supply chains will get
     developed and the prices will go down for everyone.
292. [00:25:46](None#t=1546): And we have the advantage of, we were kind
     of like, we're after Google.
293. [00:25:49](None#t=1549): So Google built all that stuff first, so
     it wasn't some proprietary thing for us.
294. [00:25:52](None#t=1552): So we're just like, all right, whatever,
     as long as it exists and it gets cheap, that's awesome for us.
295. [00:25:56](None#t=1556): And I think we're sort of in a similar
     zone on AI stuff.
296. [00:26:00](None#t=1560): I mean, I'm curious.
297. [00:26:01](None#t=1561): I mean, given the front row seat that you
     have, what is your best take on the scaling frontier for these
     models?
298. [00:26:10](None#t=1570): I mean, they continue to follow the
     scaling laws.
299. [00:26:12](None#t=1572): How much more Runway do you think we have?
300. [00:26:16](None#t=1576): I mean, lama four, I think, or whatever,
     GPT five, all of that makes sense.
301. [00:26:23](None#t=1583): But like, how much?
302. [00:26:23](None#t=1583): What's your current take on the Runway and
     what are the limiting factors?
303. [00:26:29](None#t=1589): Yeah, it's hard to know.
304. [00:26:32](None#t=1592): I think that there's the compute thing.
305. [00:26:36](None#t=1596): I mean, so without knowing exactly how far
     this scales, I'm clearly betting that it does scale right, because
     we're doing all this infrastructure, so it's hard to guess the
     exact timing.
306. [00:26:47](None#t=1607): And this is like five to seven year build
     outs of all this stuff to get to the massive scales that you want
     for llama ten down the road.
307. [00:26:57](None#t=1617): But you kind of have to work on that in
     advance because you can train the model in six or nine months, but
     to get the energy that you need, that's a long process.
308. [00:27:10](None#t=1630): So I think it will work, but I think a lot
     of it is going to come down to data and a lot of it is going to be
     in different domains.
309. [00:27:22](None#t=1642): So there isn't data on the web for.
310. [00:27:24](None#t=1644): So right now it's like you think about
     this is like companies go out, they look at all the content on the
     web, you kind of try to find all the patterns in that.
311. [00:27:34](None#t=1654): That's your pre trained model.
312. [00:27:36](None#t=1656): Then you kind of fine tune it or post
     train it in order to build the different applications or things
     that you want as you start getting towards more agentic type
     behavior.
313. [00:27:46](None#t=1666): And it just, that data set doesn't exist
     yet, so now you have to go make that data set.
314. [00:27:52](None#t=1672): I think a lot of the new work going
     forward won't be just about taking data that's out there and then
     building compute to crunch and train on it.
315. [00:28:02](None#t=1682): I actually think more of the training
     going forward will look like inference today to either be trying to
     go experiment in some spaces.
316. [00:28:10](None#t=1690): It's like, how do you create an agentic
     data set?
317. [00:28:12](None#t=1692): It's like, okay, well, it's probably some
     amount of manual work and some amount of just letting the system
     play and just experiment and generating data from its own game
     playing.
318. [00:28:25](None#t=1705): That's just one example.
319. [00:28:26](None#t=1706): But it's a type of thing that just doesn't
     exist today.
320. [00:28:28](None#t=1708): So I think that there's a question of how
     far does that go?
321. [00:28:31](None#t=1711): I would guess pretty far.
322. [00:28:33](None#t=1713): And, yeah, I mean, I'm definitely an
     optimist on this, but, I mean, tough to know.
323. [00:28:38](None#t=1718): Exactly.
324. [00:28:39](None#t=1719): Cool.
325. [00:28:40](None#t=1720): Ruchi, do you want to rewind us back to
     some of the early days of Facebook?
326. [00:28:45](None#t=1725): I mean, just related to this.
327. [00:28:48](None#t=1728): Aditya has been talking about all his
     early experiences at Facebook.
328. [00:28:52](None#t=1732): I remember we were working on Newsfeed and
     I.
329. [00:28:55](None#t=1735): I was part of so many war rooms.
330. [00:28:57](None#t=1737): You were part of the pod of six people who
     built the first newsfeed.
331. [00:29:01](None#t=1741): It was like, and I was sitting next to you
     all the time.
332. [00:29:04](None#t=1744): It's not always a good thing.
333. [00:29:05](None#t=1745): But there were so many war rooms and
     lockdowns in the early days of Facebook, particularly after we
     launched news feed.
334. [00:29:15](None#t=1755): I don't think I left the office for a
     whole week.
335. [00:29:18](None#t=1758): Yeah, well, that was because there were
     protesters in the streets of security.
336. [00:29:22](None#t=1762): Was like, yeah, you probably shouldn't go
     out the front door because people are really, really angry about
     this.
337. [00:29:29](None#t=1769): Right.
338. [00:29:29](None#t=1769): So kind of curious.
339. [00:29:31](None#t=1771): I want to live through one of your more
     recent war room experiences.
340. [00:29:35](None#t=1775): Maybe like, around llama or when the
     weights around llama got leaked or, you know, like, what does the
     war room at Facebook look like today?
341. [00:29:43](None#t=1783): So I think that there's two different
     pieces to what you're.
342. [00:29:46](None#t=1786): So I think I'm not really in those
     operational war rooms as much now.
343. [00:29:51](None#t=1791): So as much as it was with Newsfeed and
     things like that in the early days.
344. [00:29:54](None#t=1794): So I think how we process these big
     strategic things that come up, I don't know.
345. [00:30:00](None#t=1800): I feel like one of the things that I'm
     trying to do is learn how to run the company a little more smoothly
     over time.
346. [00:30:07](None#t=1807): I clearly have not succeeded at this yet.
347. [00:30:10](None#t=1810): It's like, if you look at the volatility
     in the company, it's like, ah.
348. [00:30:15](None#t=1815): But I'm just like, all right, at some
     point in this life or the next, I will hopefully figure out how to
     do this a little bit more smoothly without compromising, obviously
     trying to do really cool things.
349. [00:30:28](None#t=1828): I think that the obvious way to make
     things more stable is to stop pushing, put your foot down on the
     gas as much.
350. [00:30:36](None#t=1836): But I am not able to do that as a person.
351. [00:30:42](None#t=1842): But I do think that part of it is, I think
     we did used to run around with our hair on fire a lot.
352. [00:30:47](None#t=1847): And I think some of that was.
353. [00:30:50](None#t=1850): I don't know, you make up for lack of
     experience with more effort or something.
354. [00:30:55](None#t=1855): But I think some of this is you try to, as
     time goes on, be a little more stable about how you do stuff.
355. [00:31:01](None#t=1861): It's like, all right, when the first
     version of llama, we intended it to be an academic release, it got
     out and I thought it was pretty cool.
356. [00:31:12](None#t=1872): And we were trying to figure out exactly
     how to process this.
357. [00:31:15](None#t=1875): And it wasn't a hair on fire situation.
358. [00:31:18](None#t=1878): I didn't think it was bad.
359. [00:31:19](None#t=1879): It was awesome.
360. [00:31:20](None#t=1880): People really wanted it and we just needed
     to figure out what were the right ways to handle this.
361. [00:31:25](None#t=1885): A lot of the different crises that we have
     now, I think this is maybe an unfortunate artifact, is maybe both
     being a bigger company, but also just where the world is a little
     bit more.
362. [00:31:35](None#t=1895): I'd say more of the challenges we have are
     kind of more social and political rather than technical.
363. [00:31:42](None#t=1902): It's like with Newsfeed, what were the big
     challenges?
364. [00:31:45](None#t=1905): Yeah, it was this big change to the site,
     but also you launch Newsfeed and then immediately traffic on the
     site went up by 50% overnight because it was just like, ok, now
     people can find all this interesting stuff that's being surfaced to
     them and it's like, now we have to, how are we going to deal with
     that?
365. [00:32:00](None#t=1920): It's like, so you corralled all the
     people.
366. [00:32:02](None#t=1922): It's like, all right, let's go solve that.
367. [00:32:05](None#t=1925): And that's people want certain controls
     and we need to figure out which controls to give them.
368. [00:32:09](None#t=1929): But now I think a lot of it is, okay, so
     people want this open source llama thing that we kind of
     accidentally half did.
369. [00:32:17](None#t=1937): It's like it was intended to be open
     source, but sort of like an academic thing to start and then it
     immediately.
370. [00:32:24](None#t=1944): So we had two debates internally.
371. [00:32:25](None#t=1945): One is like, is this good?
372. [00:32:27](None#t=1947): And should we keep doing it?
373. [00:32:28](None#t=1948): And that got resolved pretty quickly.
374. [00:32:29](None#t=1949): It was like, yeah, we think this is good.
375. [00:32:31](None#t=1951): We should try to do this.
376. [00:32:32](None#t=1952): Then the second one, which I think it's
     because sometimes some of the political or social debates, they
     move so quickly.
377. [00:32:39](None#t=1959): I think the open source debate, I think,
     is going to be one of the most important technology policy debates
     of the next five to ten years.
378. [00:32:47](None#t=1967): And we have made a lot of really good
     progress already.
379. [00:32:51](None#t=1971): And I think part of the reason why we're
     making progress is because so many people are embracing and using
     lama.
380. [00:32:56](None#t=1976): And frankly, I think startups and
     entrepreneurship are generally popular and way more popular than
     big tech companies are.
381. [00:33:07](None#t=1987): So I think as a thing that we're doing, I
     don't know, is that going to be popular by itself?
382. [00:33:11](None#t=1991): I don't know.
383. [00:33:12](None#t=1992): Maybe, yes.
384. [00:33:12](None#t=1992): Maybe no.
385. [00:33:13](None#t=1993): When you get this groundswell of people
     who are using it, then it's like, hey, yeah, I think people are
     going to, people listen to that a little more and they're like,
     hey, that's good.
386. [00:33:22](None#t=2002): We want there to be new companies.
387. [00:33:24](None#t=2004): But in the early days before we actually
     did llama two, which was the kind of first commercial open source
     thing, was this huge debate, which is I'd say the kind of concern,
     risk side of it was really, I think, dominating the public
     discourse until there were actually a lot of startups that were
     using this stuff.
388. [00:33:42](None#t=2022): And that was really what we had to sort
     through internally was how do we do this in a way that is really
     responsible and safe given the somewhat unique nature of open
     source relative to closed?
389. [00:33:56](None#t=2036): And my view is, well, if we do a good job
     and if we over index on really making sure we do a good job on
     safety, then over time you'll build trust and we'll build this
     community and they're not going to want to take away open source
     from, I don't know.
390. [00:34:12](None#t=2052): If you think about what are the big
     companies today, it's like they were all built on open source
     software.
391. [00:34:18](None#t=2058): If this debate goes well, I think the next
     generation of major companies are going to be built on open source
     AI.
392. [00:34:24](None#t=2064): And I just think that there are some of
     these things where it's like, yeah, there will be challenges along
     the way that we need to deal with, but I don't know.
393. [00:34:32](None#t=2072): I think that this is going to be one of
     the most important debates and making sure we navigate it
     carefully.
394. [00:34:36](None#t=2076): And that's why we've had some more
     restrictions on what we do.
395. [00:34:39](None#t=2079): And sometimes it's a little bit slower,
     but I don't know, it's less like, ok, we got to get in a war room
     and figure this out overnight.
396. [00:34:45](None#t=2085): From llama one, leak to llama two, it was
     probably, I don't know.
397. [00:34:52](None#t=2092): How long was it?
398. [00:34:53](None#t=2093): It was several months.
399. [00:34:54](None#t=2094): Like a bunch of months?
400. [00:34:57](None#t=2097): Yeah, six months, eight months, something
     like that to kind of sort through all that stuff.
401. [00:35:01](None#t=2101): And we were, and the team was cranking on
     the model, but in the background we were like, I think figuring out
     all the responsibility stuff to make sure that we really nailed
     that and did a good job on that and laid the groundwork for the
     future.
402. [00:35:11](None#t=2111): Awesome.
403. [00:35:12](None#t=2112): Okay, let's switch tax a little bit to
     address some of the questions that the audience has submitted.
404. [00:35:18](None#t=2118): What is the one piece of advice you would
     give technologists who want to be entrepreneurs working with a lot
     of entrepreneurs here, I find that they often hit local maximus,
     what kind of advice would you give them?
405. [00:35:32](None#t=2132): Well, I think the whole minus one to zero
     idea that you have really fits my philosophy of how you want to go
     explore the space.
406. [00:35:42](None#t=2142): So when I think about when I was getting
     started, there's a lot of people who decide I want to start a
     company, and then they get really committed and they're like, do a
     thing.
407. [00:35:51](None#t=2151): But the problem is that once you get a
     bunch of people doing a thing, it's really hard to change what
     you're doing.
408. [00:35:59](None#t=2159): And it's like, yeah, you can do it through
     willpower, but it takes time.
409. [00:36:04](None#t=2164): And early on, you're just exploring a very
     dynamic and broad space, and you need to be able to just have
     meetings and make decisions inside your own head and then just be
     able to go do things differently and come out and change your mind.
410. [00:36:18](None#t=2178): And it's like, all right, I'm going to do
     a different thing now than I was doing a few hours ago.
411. [00:36:25](None#t=2185): I don't know.
412. [00:36:25](None#t=2185): So there's this, like, when I was in
     college, before I built the first version of Facebook, which I
     didn't think was going to be a big company, by the way.
413. [00:36:35](None#t=2195): I mean, it's.
414. [00:36:36](None#t=2196): Do you remember when, like, when Dustin
     and I first came out, we basically started Facebook.
415. [00:36:41](None#t=2201): He joined me because I was still taking
     all these classes, and I was, like, locked away in the computer
     science dungeon and, like, Php doing my problem sets and didn't
     have cell phone receptions when, like, the site went down, like, I
     was just.
416. [00:36:53](None#t=2213): It was just like, oh, I just, like, get
     out from doing a problem sets.
417. [00:36:55](None#t=2215): Like, site's been down for a while.
418. [00:36:56](None#t=2216): That sucks.
419. [00:36:59](None#t=2219): So Dustin joined, and he was awesome and
     basically just kind of like the first engineer and kind of Ops
     person helping to keep it running, and the company wouldn't have
     worked without him.
420. [00:37:08](None#t=2228): Dustin's, like an amazing person, but,
     yeah, Dustin.
421. [00:37:14](None#t=2234): So after that first year, first spring,
     because I launched in February, we came out to Silicon Valley and
     we were like, hey, this will be a great place to spend a summer.
422. [00:37:22](None#t=2242): This is, like, where all the companies
     come from.
423. [00:37:23](None#t=2243): We'll learn something.
424. [00:37:24](None#t=2244): It's like, surely the thing that we're
     doing now is not going to be the company that we end up working on.
425. [00:37:28](None#t=2248): Started Facebook.
426. [00:37:29](None#t=2249): It had almost a million people using it,
     and we were like, nah, this is not going to be that big of a
     company.
427. [00:37:36](None#t=2256): So I think, okay, so what's the lesson
     from this?
428. [00:37:39](None#t=2259): When I was in college, I actually built a
     bunch of different things.
429. [00:37:43](None#t=2263): I just loved building stuff.
430. [00:37:44](None#t=2264): Some of them were.
431. [00:37:46](None#t=2266): I wasn't sure what classes to take.
432. [00:37:48](None#t=2268): So I built a service that went, scraped
     the course catalog and let everyone input their, I like, what
     classes that they had taken and what they were planning on taking.
433. [00:37:57](None#t=2277): And it showed all these correlations of
     people who took this one were kind of interested in this, and heres
     how they ranked it.
434. [00:38:04](None#t=2284): And part of this was, it was just
     interesting because its like people.
435. [00:38:06](None#t=2286): I kind of started that because I wanted to
     do this crowdsourced question of to answer what classes I should
     take.
436. [00:38:13](None#t=2293): But actually just, people just sat and
     clicked through all the classes that people were taking because its
     actually just like, people really want to learn about other people,
     right?
437. [00:38:20](None#t=2300): So its like, what classes are you
     interested in taking?
438. [00:38:22](None#t=2302): Thats an interesting signal on you and an
     interesting way to get to know other people.
439. [00:38:27](None#t=2307): So all that stuff, I think, pointed
     towards, okay, I put a lot of those things together into the first
     version of Facebook, but there were probably, like, ten different
     things like that.
440. [00:38:35](None#t=2315): That I built.
441. [00:38:36](None#t=2316): Yeah, that was in high school with
     D'Angelo and.
442. [00:38:42](None#t=2322): Yeah, I mean, there were like, all these.
443. [00:38:44](None#t=2324): It's like, I probably.
444. [00:38:45](None#t=2325): The peak was at some point I was working
     on some project, and then I had finals coming up, and there was
     this class I was taking, the Rome of Augustus.
445. [00:38:56](None#t=2336): It was like a history class at Harvard.
446. [00:38:57](None#t=2337): You needed to take some litten arts, or I
     don't know what they call it now, so you needed to learn for the
     final.
447. [00:39:05](None#t=2345): What were the.
448. [00:39:06](None#t=2346): What is the, like, you just basically show
     some piece of art, and it's like, what's the historical
     significance of this?
449. [00:39:10](None#t=2350): So I was like, all right, that's like, I
     have, like, I spent my whole study period building some other
     project.
450. [00:39:16](None#t=2356): So let's, like, quickly, in a few hours,
     just, like, threw together a thing.
451. [00:39:19](None#t=2359): Like, scraped all the pieces of art, sent
     out a link to the class.
452. [00:39:22](None#t=2362): I was like, hey, I built a study tool.
453. [00:39:24](None#t=2364): If you guys want to look at this.
454. [00:39:26](None#t=2366): It just shows a random piece of art, and
     you can say what you think is significant about it, and then you
     can see what everyone else wrote, and the scores had never been
     higher on the exam.
455. [00:39:37](None#t=2377): But honestly, I really believe in this
     approach of just, you want to build different stuff and not get
     committed too quickly.
456. [00:39:44](None#t=2384): I think especially when you're a startup,
     I think when you're bigger and you can have, it's actually a lot
     easier to predict where things are going to be in the world, like,
     five or ten years from now than it is to know what is your wedge to
     get there.
457. [00:39:56](None#t=2396): I think that's the really hard thing to
     figure out.
458. [00:39:59](None#t=2399): So I don't know.
459. [00:40:01](None#t=2401): There's different styles on this.
460. [00:40:02](None#t=2402): Some people have succeeded by just saying,
     I want to go build a startup.
461. [00:40:04](None#t=2404): I'm going to go hit my head against the
     wall until I get this to work.
462. [00:40:07](None#t=2407): But I've always much more believed in,
     just go build a lot of stuff that is thematically interesting and
     you'll learn different things from it and try to not get too
     committed too quickly because it's actually pretty hard to learn
     and fully pivot through the space of things that you need to go do.
463. [00:40:23](None#t=2423): So I think, and from that perspective, my
     understanding is that really aligns with what you're all about.
464. [00:40:28](None#t=2428): And I think it's just really good.
465. [00:40:30](None#t=2430): Thank you.
466. [00:40:32](None#t=2432): A huge compliment to all of us here.
467. [00:40:34](None#t=2434): To all of us here.
468. [00:40:35](None#t=2435): But Mark's like.
469. [00:40:35](None#t=2435): I mean, just like, you're good people, you
     know, it's like, it's.
470. [00:40:40](None#t=2440): Keep going, Mark.
471. [00:40:42](None#t=2442): I get to go all day.
472. [00:40:43](None#t=2443): You've got a nice chain.
473. [00:40:45](None#t=2445): You're a surfer.
474. [00:40:47](None#t=2447): Okay.
475. [00:40:48](None#t=2448): But, you know, I think.
476. [00:40:49](None#t=2449): I mean, in that vein, when people ask me,
     like, the different things I worked on at Facebook, I can tell them
     that there are a few things that I launched that are successful,
     but I also worked on a bunch of things that kind of just didn't
     make it right.
477. [00:41:03](None#t=2463): And I think even internally, we kind of
     had this attitude, which is that you should be pushing really hard
     towards kind of like, what you think might be a great product, but
     also not hold onto it so tightly that you end up almost getting
     your ego attached to it.
478. [00:41:16](None#t=2476): Because the whole point of building and
     trying is that a bunch of stuff won't work.
479. [00:41:20](None#t=2480): And that's okay.
480. [00:41:22](None#t=2482): And that's something I still admire about
     Facebook today, which is that it feels as though that you're
     constantly pushing, but with the knowledge that not everything will
     work.
481. [00:41:29](None#t=2489): And that's okay.
482. [00:41:30](None#t=2490): That's a feature.
483. [00:41:32](None#t=2492): Yeah.
484. [00:41:32](None#t=2492): No, I mean, I think I've made more public
     mistakes than, like, anyone else in the industry.
485. [00:41:37](None#t=2497): There's some Michael Jordan ad for this
     that I always find very inspiring.
486. [00:41:41](None#t=2501): It really speaks to me.
487. [00:41:43](None#t=2503): It's like this ad about how he's like, I
     failed over and over again, and then at the end, he's like, that's
     why I succeed.
488. [00:41:49](None#t=2509): But I think it's.
489. [00:41:50](None#t=2510): I don't know, the Einstein biography that
     Walter Isaacson, I think, sort of makes the same point.
490. [00:41:54](None#t=2514): It's like Einstein got all these theories
     wrong, but it's like, okay, he got some good ones, right?
491. [00:42:00](None#t=2520): And it's like, that's kind of what
     matters.
492. [00:42:03](None#t=2523): Yeah, I think you talked about this but
     maybe I'll ask another question, which is that I've worked for many
     startups and I've helped many startups as well.
493. [00:42:16](None#t=2536): But when I think of that early team at
     Facebook, it gives me the chills.
494. [00:42:20](None#t=2540): Yes, we were in experience, but it totally
     gives me the chills.
495. [00:42:23](None#t=2543): And I kind of have.
496. [00:42:25](None#t=2545): I'm curious about what you get right with
     the hiring.
497. [00:42:29](None#t=2549): What are some important hires you made,
     and why were they the best people?
498. [00:42:36](None#t=2556): Well, I think it was sort of this tale of
     two cities.
499. [00:42:41](None#t=2561): I think that there were a lot of really
     excited and inspired people who were coming out of college because
     they used the product, and they were just like, this thing is
     awesome.
500. [00:42:50](None#t=2570): I want to work at this company.
501. [00:42:53](None#t=2573): And then the other side, which I think I
     just failed at for a long time, was building an executive team.
502. [00:43:01](None#t=2581): And we went, I mean, we, like, flamed
     through so many executives, and it's like.
503. [00:43:07](None#t=2587): Cause I had this platonic model in my head
     of, like, here's what a head of engineering should look like.
504. [00:43:13](None#t=2593): And I think that they were probably all
     pretty reasonable people, but it was just like this big culture
     mismatch until finally Peter Thiel took me out to lunch one day,
     and he's like, all right, this clearly is not working well, right?
505. [00:43:26](None#t=2606): It's like you.
506. [00:43:30](None#t=2610): You aren't jiving with these executives,
     and you should basically just take people who you want to spend
     time with because you pretty much live at the office or you're
     working on this with your whole life.
507. [00:43:47](None#t=2627): And I think there's just sort of this kind
     of bandwidth thing with the early team where it's like you want to
     be speaking the same language and have a lot of the similar kind of
     assumptions and obviously want to challenge each other, too.
508. [00:44:01](None#t=2641): The folks who were there had different
     views on things, but I think also had enough of an overlapping
     foundation of values.
509. [00:44:09](None#t=2649): And I think that was sort of when it
     started to click a little more to your point.
510. [00:44:15](None#t=2655): It's embracing the chaos of some of the
     stuff being, yeah, it's like the people aren't quite as
     experienced, but we're like, a little more on the same page.
511. [00:44:28](None#t=2668): And I think one of the things that's been
     awesome about the company and where we are now is all these people
     have now grown up, and now they're all really seasoned, amazing
     executives who by any definition across the industry are extremely
     experienced.
512. [00:44:44](None#t=2684): And we've all worked together for, like,
     15 years.
513. [00:44:47](None#t=2687): And it's like, so people are like, okay,
     well, how do you build that?
514. [00:44:50](None#t=2690): It's like, you can't.
515. [00:44:51](None#t=2691): I mean, it's like, you basically.
516. [00:44:53](None#t=2693): Yeah.
517. [00:44:53](None#t=2693): I mean, what I try to do is I basically, I
     have a relatively large management team because we just.
518. [00:45:01](None#t=2701): We have a lot of different products, and I
     basically, like, I want to be pretty hands on.
519. [00:45:05](None#t=2705): And to me, part of that is I don't want
     to, like, work through just like, six or seven people.
520. [00:45:09](None#t=2709): I have a group of, like, 25 people, right.
521. [00:45:11](None#t=2711): Who, like, run.
522. [00:45:12](None#t=2712): There's maybe, like 15 product groups, you
     know, everything from the major apps to ads to AI to AI research to
     smart glasses to mister headsets, all the different things.
523. [00:45:22](None#t=2722): Then you have all the business functions,
     and it's all there.
524. [00:45:24](None#t=2724): And we just spend, like, hours together
     every week.
525. [00:45:26](None#t=2726): And it's just part of my style of running
     the company is have it be kind of this bonded group.
526. [00:45:33](None#t=2733): I don't know.
527. [00:45:35](None#t=2735): One of the things I'm really proud of is
     of the product folks.
528. [00:45:37](None#t=2737): I think on the business side, it's a
     little bit different.
529. [00:45:40](None#t=2740): Hire a general counsel who has a lot of
     experience as a general counsel.
530. [00:45:43](None#t=2743): Right.
531. [00:45:43](None#t=2743): It's like, that's like, I think I got to
     be really important thing.
532. [00:45:47](None#t=2747): But although Chris Cox, who is the chief
     product officer and is like, yeah, yeah.
533. [00:45:55](None#t=2755): And, I mean, Dustin and I had this huge
     fight about this because Chris was like, he was clearly a very
     promising young man.
534. [00:46:01](None#t=2761): And it was like, all right.
535. [00:46:03](None#t=2763): Like, Dustin was like, we need, like, I
     really need him to be an engineering manager.
536. [00:46:06](None#t=2766): I'm like, Dustin, you already have five
     engineering managers.
537. [00:46:09](None#t=2769): It's like, I really need a head of
     Hrtaine.
538. [00:46:11](None#t=2771): Like, I don't know.
539. [00:46:13](None#t=2773): It was tough.
540. [00:46:13](None#t=2773): It was tough to.
541. [00:46:14](None#t=2774): It was tough to hire those days.
542. [00:46:15](None#t=2775): He was a good HR head.
543. [00:46:17](None#t=2777): He was great.
544. [00:46:17](None#t=2777): He was great.
545. [00:46:18](None#t=2778): And he was very generous to do it for a
     few years before going back to product, but, yeah, no, it's.
546. [00:46:26](None#t=2786): But today, even one of the things that I'm
     most proud of is of all the kind of top product group leads, none
     of them started at the company as a product group lead.
547. [00:46:32](None#t=2792): They all started one or two clicks down.
548. [00:46:35](None#t=2795): We hire a bunch of people in as directors.
549. [00:46:37](None#t=2797): Some of the people who are at the company,
     a lot of them start off as individuals.
550. [00:46:42](None#t=2802): One of them started off as an admin,
     actually two now who are on the management team and just kind of,
     like, worked their way up doing different things.
551. [00:46:52](None#t=2812): People started non technical roles, came
     over to technical roles.
552. [00:46:55](None#t=2815): People started technical roles, go to
     other stuff.
553. [00:46:57](None#t=2817): But I don't know.
554. [00:46:58](None#t=2818): I think that that's.
555. [00:46:58](None#t=2818): It's been really cool.
556. [00:46:59](None#t=2819): Yeah.
557. [00:47:00](None#t=2820): And it's just like a really good group,
     and it's I mean, you can power through a lot of stuff yourself, but
     I really think that this, I mean, it's, by the time you get a
     little further along with the idea, it really becomes more of a
     team sport.
558. [00:47:14](None#t=2834): And the amount of fun that you will have
     and how painful the lows are really just depends on the people you
     have around you.
559. [00:47:21](None#t=2841): And it is hard.
560. [00:47:23](None#t=2843): This stuff always takes longer than you
     expect it to take longer.
561. [00:47:26](None#t=2846): You have all these issues.
562. [00:47:27](None#t=2847): So I don't know.
563. [00:47:29](None#t=2849): I think to me, that's probably one of the
     reasons why I, like, I've remained excited and happy doing the
     stuff that I do is just like, I love the people I work with.
564. [00:47:36](None#t=2856): They're like my closest friends.
565. [00:47:38](None#t=2858): Just following up on that.
566. [00:47:40](None#t=2860): How have you managed the emotional ups and
     downs of starting a company, running a company, and how has that
     evolved over the last two decades?
567. [00:47:51](None#t=2871): Yeah, I don't know.
568. [00:47:52](None#t=2872): It's tricky.
569. [00:47:55](None#t=2875): I think some of the time when I, I think
     as the company's gotten bigger, the cycles are longer.
570. [00:48:02](None#t=2882): So it used to be like you're saying it's
     like, all right, we're launching news feed.
571. [00:48:05](None#t=2885): It's like we built the whole first version
     of news feed in a pretty short period of time.
572. [00:48:08](None#t=2888): And then it's like there's a spike and
     then it's like, ah, some people are upset and it's like, okay.
573. [00:48:11](None#t=2891): A week later it's sort of resolved and
     it's okay.
574. [00:48:14](None#t=2894): But, like, I think at the scale of what
     we're doing now, I think that's one of the things that's fun.
575. [00:48:18](None#t=2898): But it's also quite frenetic about
     building a startup.
576. [00:48:21](None#t=2901): And it just, you do kind of always feel
     like you're, you bounce between euphoria and like, feeling like
     you're about to die pretty frequently.
577. [00:48:32](None#t=2912): I don't miss that.
578. [00:48:36](None#t=2916): It's tiring.
579. [00:48:36](None#t=2916): It's tiring.
580. [00:48:38](None#t=2918): I don't think I could do that again.
581. [00:48:41](None#t=2921): But so now the cycles are longer and I
     don't know, I think it's like, it's some amount of willpower, some
     amount of like, the people around you keep you going and some
     amount of maybe you don't fully realize how bad certain things are
     until you're out of them.
582. [00:49:01](None#t=2941): And I think that that's like, I mean, I
     think some of the stuff that we've dealt with, I don't know.
583. [00:49:10](None#t=2950): I mean, it's just, I think some of it, you
     just like, try to put 1ft in front of the other and you keep doing
     your work and then you look back afterwards and you're like, wow,
     that was really something.
584. [00:49:24](None#t=2964): I feel like just hearing you say that, I
     mean, even for Mark, the activation energy to start again would be
     really, really hard.
585. [00:49:32](None#t=2972): So I think the only thing you can do is
     put one step, one step ahead of the other and just keep going and
     not give up.
586. [00:49:41](None#t=2981): I don't think you guys have a choice.
587. [00:49:42](None#t=2982): Just don't give up.
588. [00:49:44](None#t=2984): Certainly not with ruchi here.
589. [00:49:47](None#t=2987): So maybe switching gears to some fun
     stuff.
590. [00:49:53](None#t=2993): So during the pandemic, I personally
     picked up a bunch of new sports.
591. [00:50:01](None#t=3001): Learned how to ski, call myself an
     intermediate professional at surfing, learned how to wake surf.
592. [00:50:11](None#t=3011): I can foil a little bit, and it's been
     amazing, right?
593. [00:50:14](None#t=3014): Like, all these sports just kind of give
     me an outlet to just be out in nature and learn a bunch of new
     things.
594. [00:50:19](None#t=3019): You obviously picked up a bunch of new
     things yourself.
595. [00:50:23](None#t=3023): MMA, foiling a bunch of other things.
596. [00:50:27](None#t=3027): What do you love about kind of doing these
     sports?
597. [00:50:29](None#t=3029): Has there been some amount of transfer
     learning between these sports and how you apply it to work?
598. [00:50:36](None#t=3036): So, for me, the reason why I love MMA is
     it is like I was just talking about how the cycle is very long when
     you're running a bigger company, especially when you're doing
     hardware, or it's like you're training some foundation model.
599. [00:50:48](None#t=3048): It's like, all right, let's go work on
     this for nine months.
600. [00:50:50](None#t=3050): And then.
601. [00:50:50](None#t=3050): Okay, so there is something that's nice in
     a bounded way about being like, all right, I need to focus on this
     or else I'm just literally gonna get punched in the face.
602. [00:51:02](None#t=3062): And the payoff is pretty big.
603. [00:51:03](None#t=3063): It's like I get to punch someone else in
     the face.
604. [00:51:05](None#t=3065): It's like.
605. [00:51:08](None#t=3068): It's like they'll never let me do that in
     the office anymore.
606. [00:51:16](None#t=3076): You know?
607. [00:51:17](None#t=3077): All this ends with Alex Pereira, kind of
     like in your.
608. [00:51:19](None#t=3079): What's up?
609. [00:51:20](None#t=3080): Oh, man, Alex is awesome.
610. [00:51:22](None#t=3082): But, yeah, no, so I think similar journey
     to you.
611. [00:51:28](None#t=3088): I mean, I used to, when I was younger, be
     pretty competitive athletically, and then started the company and
     stopped doing most of that stuff.
612. [00:51:40](None#t=3100): And basically I'd stayed in shape.
613. [00:51:42](None#t=3102): I lifted some weights or something, but I
     didn't have a fitness goal for a while.
614. [00:51:46](None#t=3106): And then at the beginning of the pandemic,
     when everything went remote for a bit, it was like, all right,
     let's get more into running.
615. [00:51:57](None#t=3117): And our family spent some time out in
     Hawaii, and it was gotten to surfing, and I was like, all right,
     this is really good, right?
616. [00:52:04](None#t=3124): It's like, because it's like you're in
     nature.
617. [00:52:06](None#t=3126): It's beautiful.
618. [00:52:08](None#t=3128): It's like you're kind of physical, but it
     has a purpose.
619. [00:52:11](None#t=3131): You're like, you don't want to get crushed
     by the wave, but it's fun when you're on it.
620. [00:52:15](None#t=3135): It's strategic.
621. [00:52:16](None#t=3136): And then since I got, all right, so that's
     done.
622. [00:52:18](None#t=3138): I still spend some time out in Hawaii, but
     I don't live there.
623. [00:52:21](None#t=3141): So it's like, what's the land version of
     this?
624. [00:52:23](None#t=3143): And it's like, I need to learn a martial
     art.
625. [00:52:25](None#t=3145): And then it's like, everything just
     escalates, right?
626. [00:52:26](None#t=3146): So it's like, I started doing this with a
     few friends, and we were training, and we were like, all right,
     just train.
627. [00:52:32](None#t=3152): And one of my friends is like, I'm going
     to go do a competition.
628. [00:52:34](None#t=3154): And I was like, all right, that's cool.
629. [00:52:37](None#t=3157): I'm really curious to see how this turns
     out for you.
630. [00:52:40](None#t=3160): I'm like, I'm not going to do a
     competition because that will be just absolutely humiliating.
631. [00:52:45](None#t=3165): It's like I go and just get choked out by
     someone or something.
632. [00:52:48](None#t=3168): But then he went and he did pretty well,
     and I was like, no.
633. [00:52:51](None#t=3171): If he gets that guy, it's like, so this is
     like, all right, I'm going to the next competition.
634. [00:52:59](None#t=3179): So we went and won a bunch of medals and
     stuff, and I was like, all right.
635. [00:53:03](None#t=3183): So I negotiated with Priscilla that I can
     do one competitive MMA fight.
636. [00:53:08](None#t=3188): I was like, all right, look, I could do
     jiu jitsu for a long time, but I feel like there's some limit to
     the head drama that you want to take in this line of work.
637. [00:53:18](None#t=3198): So it's like, I was going to do one
     competitive MMA fight, and then I tore my knee, and now I'm back.
638. [00:53:24](None#t=3204): He's back.
639. [00:53:25](None#t=3205): I mean, what's the date for that one?
640. [00:53:28](None#t=3208): What's the date?
641. [00:53:30](None#t=3210): I haven't decided yet.
642. [00:53:31](None#t=3211): I need to get confident with my knee, but
     I don't know.
643. [00:53:38](None#t=3218): I would guess, in the spring, I think,
     some more time to ramp up.
644. [00:53:41](None#t=3221): You heard it here first.
645. [00:53:44](None#t=3224): I mean, not to say that.
646. [00:53:46](None#t=3226): I mean, let me give you another anecdote
     about Marx, like competitiveness.
647. [00:53:50](None#t=3230): Yeah.
648. [00:53:50](None#t=3230): Just a little competitor.
649. [00:53:51](None#t=3231): I mean, maybe back in.
650. [00:53:53](None#t=3233): I want to say this is 2009.
651. [00:53:54](None#t=3234): It was this, you know, Mark had a theme
     for, you know, multiple years.
652. [00:53:58](None#t=3238): This was a serious year.
653. [00:54:00](None#t=3240): So Mark was showing up in a shirt and a
     tie.
654. [00:54:03](None#t=3243): But then we decided that we were going to
     have a push up competition to see who would be the first person in
     the office who could do 10,000 push ups.
655. [00:54:10](None#t=3250): Self reported.
656. [00:54:11](None#t=3251): And Alex Himmel won, and he now runs our
     AR glasses program.
657. [00:54:15](None#t=3255): He won, but mark was a.
658. [00:54:17](None#t=3257): He was a close second.
659. [00:54:18](None#t=3258): I still remember being in, not because of
     that, because he's been around for a while and has been doing
     awesome work.
660. [00:54:23](None#t=3263): And he was just, like a dude, like a
     random engineer at the time.
661. [00:54:26](None#t=3266): And then now he's one of the top people at
     the company.
662. [00:54:29](None#t=3269): That's right.
663. [00:54:30](None#t=3270): Okay, I've got the sign to wrap up, so I'm
     going to ask the one last concluding question.
664. [00:54:36](None#t=3276): So the world often asks me what you're
     like.
665. [00:54:40](None#t=3280): I try to avoid answering Iska, but
     sometimes don't make eye contact and walk away.
666. [00:54:47](None#t=3287): But, you know, sometimes I tell them, you
     know, he's like one of my closest friends that I would turn to in
     my darkest hours.
667. [00:54:54](None#t=3294): And what I find fascinating when I think
     about you is the more famous you've gotten, the more time you've
     made for us.
668. [00:55:02](None#t=3302): And I just want to ask you, what are some
     things that are important to you that most people don't know to
     value?
669. [00:55:12](None#t=3312): I mean, I think what we talked about, the
     kind of physical activity part, but.
670. [00:55:15](None#t=3315): And we talked a little bit about, like,
     the relationships part and trust, but I don't know.
671. [00:55:19](None#t=3319): I mean, going back to the first topic that
     we talked about with building good things versus building awesome
     things, I'd say for this kind of chapter of my life, the, there's
     one more dimension to it besides doing awesome things, which is
     doing awesome things with people who I really enjoy and, like,
     wanna.
672. [00:55:37](None#t=3337): Like, sometimes it's like I wanna go do a
     project because I like that person and want to go out of my way to
     find ways to work with them because they're a good person.
673. [00:55:47](None#t=3347): I want to help them, or I'm going to learn
     something from them.
674. [00:55:51](None#t=3351): They're interesting, and there's a lot of
     different things.
675. [00:55:56](None#t=3356): A lot of it.
676. [00:55:57](None#t=3357): Obviously, the bulk of my energy still
     goes towards meta, and one of the really fun things has been
     broadening out my relationship with Priscilla.
677. [00:56:06](None#t=3366): It's obviously, and we have a family now,
     but we also have been running CZi, and that's just been really cool
     to see her grow and basically lead this huge organization.
678. [00:56:18](None#t=3378): And then there's some stuff that's just
     sort of random, right?
679. [00:56:21](None#t=3381): It's like, I want to work on this project
     to raise the highest quality beef in the world, and it's like, all
     right.
680. [00:56:29](None#t=3389): And it's like, why?
681. [00:56:30](None#t=3390): I don't know, but it's like.
682. [00:56:32](None#t=3392): But I think doing it with some people who
     I think are awesome, but, yeah, I think it's like those things,
     that's just what matters to me at this point.
683. [00:56:41](None#t=3401): And maybe it's partially because it's like
     the company's big and successful.
684. [00:56:46](None#t=3406): And I guess, yeah, we need to keep on
     doing well in order to kind of keep a general momentum and keep
     things going.
685. [00:56:53](None#t=3413): But it was never like getting to some
     valuation or something that motivated me.
686. [00:56:57](None#t=3417): It was always what we were building.
687. [00:57:02](None#t=3422): I don't know.
688. [00:57:02](None#t=3422): I guess for this phase, it's kind of being
     able to work on great things and being able to build these really
     deep relationships that's part of just doing stuff for a long time
     is when you're younger, you don't have friendships for 20 years yet
     because you're younger.
689. [00:57:21](None#t=3441): I think we're at a point now in our life
     where it's like, oh, yeah, I have a bunch of those, and that's
     great, but we're also young enough that we can build them.
690. [00:57:29](None#t=3449): They're going to take 20 years, but I
     think you can do that, and that's what's important to me.
691. [00:57:40](None#t=3460): And you guys have said a lot of nice stuff
     about me, and you guys are some of my closest friends, too.
692. [00:57:44](None#t=3464): I think what you're doing is great.
693. [00:57:46](None#t=3466): And the work that you did at Facebook
     early on, I'm eternally grateful for because we wouldn't be where
     we are without it.
694. [00:57:53](None#t=3473): But you're also.
695. [00:57:53](None#t=3473): I mean, I was joking about this before.
696. [00:57:54](None#t=3474): You guys are just really good people, and
     I think the people who get to work with you and get to be coached
     by you are really just lucky and fortunate.
697. [00:58:05](None#t=3485): And that's part of the reason why I wanted
     to come and do this is just because I have a lot of faith in what
     you're doing.
698. [00:58:12](None#t=3492): And I think philosophically, it's the
     right kind of push in the world compared to other different kind of
     incubators that have different philosophies or different things
     like this.
699. [00:58:23](None#t=3503): I don't know.
700. [00:58:24](None#t=3504): That's what matters to me at this phase of
     my life, though.
701. [00:58:27](None#t=3507): Thank you.
702. [00:58:27](None#t=3507): Thank you.
