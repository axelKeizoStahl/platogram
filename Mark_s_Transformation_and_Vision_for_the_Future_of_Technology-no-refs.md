## Introduction

As Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, reflects on his
personal transformation and the evolution of technology, he notes that
"I'm trying to be less of a main character and more of a foil for other
people" . This shift in perspective is reflective of the changing
landscape of technology, where the focus is no longer on individual
achievements but on creating breakthroughs that inspire and empower
billions of people.

Over the past 20 years, technology has undergone significant
transformations, from the early days of Facebook to the current phase of
politics, volatility, and responsibility . However, as Mark notes, "we
now understand the different dimensions of that and have done a ton of
work to do the things we need to do" , allowing for a pivot towards more
proactive and awesome things.

The next phase of technology is focused on breakthroughs, with Mark
emphasizing that "there's a difference between doing good things and
doing awesome things, and it's a difference in inspiration" . This is
reflected in Meta's work on AR glasses and VR headsets, which have the
potential to inspire and empower billions of people .

As Mark looks to the future, he is driven by a desire to build awesome
things, not just good things. He notes that "life is too short" and that
"the biggest scarcity that we have is just the amount of time that we
have" , emphasizing the importance of focusing on what truly matters.

In this paper, we will explore the evolution of technology and the
importance of creating breakthroughs that inspire and empower people. We
will examine the challenges and opportunities of building awesome things
and discuss the lessons learned from Mark's experiences as a founder and
CEO. As Mark notes, "there's a lot of awesome stuff that will get built"
, and it is our hope that this paper will contribute to that
conversation.

## Discussion

### Personal Transformation

Mark, you've had a personal transformation in the past couple of years.
What led to this transformation? Mark: I injured my knee, so I had to
stop fighting and training for nine months. I decided to grow out my
hair, and it's been a great experience.

### The Evolution of Technology

You've been the main character in technology for the last 20 years. How
would you delineate the chapters you've seen, and what chapter do you
think we are in now? Mark: I'm trying to be less of a main character and
more of a foil for other people. We've gone through different phases,
from the early Facebook days to the last ten years, which have been
marked by politics, volatility, and responsibility. I think we now
understand the different dimensions of that and have done a ton of work
to do the things we need to do. This has allowed us to pivot more to
offense and doing more proactive, awesome things.

### The Next Phase of Computing

When I think about the next phase, I think about doing breakthrough
things that are more awesome and inspiring, regardless of scale. For the
next computing platform, with AR glasses and VR headsets, I think we're
going to get to a point where billions of people are going to have these
things. The experience of trying on AR glasses for the first time is
awesome and inspiring. I think that's what I'm excited about for the
next phase of my career.

### Doing Awesome Things

I have a saying that I like to tell people at Meta: there's a difference
between doing good things and doing awesome things, and it's a
difference in inspiration. I think this is a phase to try to be awesome
and try to build some awesome things. As you said, one of the catchlines
we use at SPC is that you come here to throw away the good ideas in
favor of the great ones. I think I'm going to update that to throwing
away the good ideas in favor of the awesome ones.

I think we can all have good ideas, but it's the awesome ones that we're
going for. Speaking of ten-year arcs, I think one of the things that we
tend to forget in the excitement of these LLM releases, particularly
with Llama, is that you started FAIR almost ten years ago. One of the
last projects I remember working on with you at Facebook personally was
Coefficient back in 2010, trying to put a weight on every edge on our
graph using machine learning techniques.

### The Early Days of FAIR

When you started investing in FAIR, can you take us through the early
days? I mean, back in 2014, we were still in the AI winter. What were
some of the seeds that you were trying to plant back in the minus one to
zero days of FAIR?

### Building the Next Platform

Yeah, so after 2012, when Facebook went public and reached a billion
people, I was trying to figure out what's next. Because Facebook was
still growing, which is mind-boggling, but I was like, "Okay, what's the
next step?" Part of it was, "Okay, I built one social app, but can we
build four more billion-people apps or take things that started small
and build them to be really big?"

### Defining the Next Major Platform

And then it was like, "Okay, what are the next platforms?" We didn't
play a role in defining smartphones, and we tried later with Android,
but it was clear that this platform was solidified, and we weren't going
to influence it much. So even though it might take 15 or 20 years for
the next major platform to come about, I knew I had to start working on
it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Mark's transformation and vision for the future of
technology are centered around building "awesome things" that inspire
billions of people. As he reflects on the past 20 years in technology,
from the early Facebook days to the current phase of politics,
volatility, and responsibility, Mark emphasizes the importance of doing
"breakthrough things that are more awesome and inspiring, regardless of
scale" . He believes that the next phase of his career will be focused

glasses and VR headsets, which will enable billions of people to
experience new and innovative technologies.

Mark's approach to entrepreneurship and building companies is centered
around the idea of "minus one to zero" , which means exploring new ideas
and spaces without being too committed to a specific outcome. He
believes that this approach allows for more flexibility and creativity,
and that it is essential for building successful companies. As he says,
"I think that's one of the things that's the weirdest about this, is
it's kind of comforting to think, hey, there are all these things that
people should be on and someone else has got this, right? And it's like,
no, no one else has got this" .

Mark also emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships and
trust with others. He believes that working with people who share
similar values and goals is essential for building successful companies
and achieving great things. As he says, "I want to work on this project
to raise the highest quality beef in the world, and it's like, all
right. And it's like, why? I don't know, but it's like... doing it with
some people who I think are awesome" .

In terms of advice for entrepreneurs and technologists, Mark emphasizes
the importance of being open to new ideas and experiences. He believes
that trying new things and taking risks is essential for learning and
growth, and that it is never too late to start something new. As he
says, "I think you can do whatever you want as long as you put your mind
to it" .

Overall, Mark's vision for the future of technology is centered around
building innovative and inspiring technologies that enable people to
experience new and exciting things. His approach to entrepreneurship and
building companies is centered around the idea of "minus one to zero",
and he emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships and
trust with others. As he says, "I think that's what matters to me at
this phase of my life, though" .
